How to play this game - 

  -- When the game loads, it will display four buttons and they all have four different colours. When user presses any key on keyboard, the game will start and it will flash one of the button. The user will have to click on that button, if the user hits on the correct button then the game goes on and the next sequence will be shown to the user. The next sequence will have two button flashing, one will be the previous one and the second one will be the new one added to the sequence. The game will go on as long as user matches the game pattern(i.e hit correct buttons according to the sequence). The longer the game goes on, the harder it will be for the user to remember game sequence and at some point, user might make a mistake and game will get over. This game really challenges mental capability of user as he/she have to continously focus in the game to get the sequence right. The user can also start the game again by pressing any key and a new game will be displayed for the user with a totally different game sequence.
